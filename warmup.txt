With your breakout room, take turns answering the following questions:

What are the differences between GET vs. POST and why use one over the other?

Quick java tutorial on Difference between GET and POST method in HTTP. Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client
to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string
while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server in http protocol.


What is Maven?

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects
Maven addresses two aspects of building software: how software is built, and its dependencies.
 It comes with pre-defined targets for performing certain well-defined tasks such as compilation of code and its packaging.
 Maven dynamically downloads Java libraries and Maven plug-ins from one or more repositories such as the Maven 2


What is a JAR? WAR?
The JAR files are the files that have Java class files, associated metadata and resources aggregated into a single file to execute a Java application.
Whereas, the WAR files are the files that contain Servlet, JSP, HTML, JavaScript and other files necessary for developing web applications.

What is Tomcat?
Apache Tomcat is an open-source implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and WebSocket technologies.
Tomcat provides a "pure Java" HTTP web server environment in which Java code can run
Tomcat is the piece of software that handles the lower level networking details of accepting HTTP requests and forwarding them on to our code
that can interact with the requests at a higher level.


What is a Java Servlet?
A servlet is a Java class that extends the HttpServlet class from the servlet library. A servlet's most basic functionality is to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Servlets also allow us to create dynamic web pages with Java
Servlet is a class that handles requests, processes them and reply back with a response.

What is a JSP?
JSP stands for Java Server Pages. JSP allows us to create HTML pages with dynamic content by letting us mix Java code into our HTM

In a JSP, what is the difference between <%@ %>, <!% %>, <%= %>, and <% %>?


Is there a difference between the following two ways of including a navbar other than syntax?

  <jsp:include page=“partials/navbar.jsp”></jsp:include>

    vs.
  <%@ include file=“partials/navbar.jsp” %>

  There's a huge difference. As has been mentioned, <%@ include is a static include, <jsp:include is a dynamic include. Think of it as a difference between a macro and a function call (if you are familiar with those terms). Another way of putting it,
  a static include is exactly the same thing as copy-pasting the exact content of the included file (the "code") at the location of the <%@ include statement (which is exactly what the JSP compiler will do.

  A dynamic include will make a request (using the request dispatcher) that will execute the indicated page and then include the output from the page in the output of the calling page, in place of the <jsp:include statement.

  The big difference here is that with a dynamic include, the included page will execute in it's own pageContext. And since it's a request, you can send parameters to the page the same way you can send parameters along with any other request.
   A static include, on the other hand, is just a piece of code that will execute inside the context of the calling page. If you statically include the same file more than once, the code in that file will exist in multiple locations on the calling page so something like


What is JSTL?
